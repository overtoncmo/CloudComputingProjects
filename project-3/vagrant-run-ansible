# We now use the Ansible provisioner
#
# in the following, install= true will install ansible in the
# created or provisioned guest vm. Once ansible is installed, any
# additional configuration we plan to do will be taken from the
# supplied playbook. Moreover, we can also tell ansible which
# Inventory file it should use. This inventory file will appear in the
# /vagrant directory (which is the same directory on your host that has
# the vagrantfile but is mounted as /vagrant in the guest machine)
#
# Please note that the get facts about cloud will fail because we haven't
# installed openstacksdk and ansible galaxy plugin. All those steps
# are left for you to fill up
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
  # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com.

  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.

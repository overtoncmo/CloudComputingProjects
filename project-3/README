** How to Run The Code **

As in Programming Assignemnt 2, run the Ansible Playbook on your host laptop
to create a Vagrant VM and two cloud VMs. Then, manually SSH into Cloud VM2
which is the kubemaster. From here, you can run commands with the K8s CLI
utilities, but beyond that, we haven't been able to complete as of yet.
The issues and obstacles described below have impeded our progress despite
continuing to work on this project and find solutions to these errors.


** Collaboration, Effort Expended, and Obstacles **

As before, we have continued to collaborate on this assignment and split the
work as evenly as possible. The main learning curve of this assignment so far
is getting even more comfortable using Ansible in a more advanced setting,
as well as learning to actually use Kubernetes and Docker.

Although we have been working together to investigate bugs we encounter,
we have have had many issues throughout the process of milestone 1.
After having to manually recreate VM2 with flavor m1.medium (instead of resizing
it), we had other problems more recently installing Kubernetes and Docker using
Ansible, although it seems that these issues have been fixed.

Currently, although Docker and Kubernetes are installed, the configuration
files have been set, UFW rules have been updated, the correct IP addresses are
being used, etc., we just overcame an issue where kubeadm was failing to create
a cluster successfully. Now that we have a cluster, upon checking the status,
it says that the connection was refused as shown. To investigate this, we
tried running some Docker commands, but Docker is failing to start (which is
likely causing some of our other problems as well). While we work on
finding a solution to these issues, along with this README, we have submitted
a quick screen recording of the output when we run this command, as well as the
playbook which installs Docker and Kubernetes.
